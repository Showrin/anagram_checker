## Project Setup

Clone the repo first. To do so, go to the directory where you want to keep this repo. Then open the terminal from here and run the following command.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:Showrin/anagram_checker.git
```

<br/>

Then navigate to the repository using this command.

```
$ cd anagram_checker
```

<br/>

After cloning, if you are using **`yarn`**, install the required modules by running the following command.

Or use the following command if you are using **`npm`**.

```
$ npm install
```

<br/>

Now open the **`index.html`** file with any browser and you will get the following UI. Here you can give two strings and pressing enter or pressing the button, you can check whether the given strings are anagram or not.

## Algorithm Explanation

- First convert all charaters to lowercase.
- Then remove all the space characters. (To do so, split strings by the space characters and join them. Now all the spaces have gone.)

- After that sort both strings.
- Then compare these two sorted strings.
- If they are anagram, they must be equal otherwise they are not anagram.

## Write and Run Tests

You can add your tests in **`./modules/anagram_checker.test.js`** this file like the following:

```
test("Should not be anagram", () => {
  expect(anagramChecker("eat", "tar")).toBe(false);
});

test("Should not be anagram when there is an empty string", () => {
  expect(anagramChecker("lamp", "")).toBe(false);
});
```

<br/>

After that you can run tests using this command in the console.

```
yarn test
```

<br/>

Or use the following if you are using npm.

```
npm test
```
