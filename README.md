# Anagram Checker

It's a simple program to check whether two strings are anagram or not.

## Project Setup

Clone the repo first. To do so, go to the directory where you want to keep this repo. Then open the terminal from here and run the following command.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:Showrin/anagram_checker.git
```

<br/>

Then navigate to the repository using this command.

```
$ cd anagram_checker
```

<br/>

After cloning, if you are using **`yarn`**, install the required modules by running the following command.

```
$ yarn
```

<br/>

Or use the following command if you are using **`npm`**.

```
$ npm install
```

<br/>

Now open the **`index.html`** file with any browser and you will get the following UI. Here you can give to string and pressing enter or pressing the button, you can check whether the given strings are anagram or not.

| ---------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| babel-cli        | ^6.26.0 | It's being used for using ES6 import-export in node                        |
| babel-preset-env | ^1.7.0  | It's being used for using ES6 import-export in node                        |
| chalk            | ^4.1.0  | It's being used for making test completion texts colorfull in the terminal |

## Algorithm Explanation

- First convert all charaters to lowercase.
- Then remove all the space characters. (To do so, split strings by the space characters and join them. Now all the spaces have gone)

- After that sort both of the strings
- Then compare these two sorted strings
- If they are anagram, they will be equal otherwise not anagram

## test( _testDescription, testFunction, expectedValue_ )

It doesn't return anything. But it is responsible for checking whether a test case passes or fails and prints the test result in the console. It compares the return value of the `testFunction` and `expectedValue`. If both values are same, it will print the `testDescription` in the console with success color and indicator, Otherwise it will print the `testDescription` in the console with failure color and indicator.

#### Arguments

1. **`testDescription`** `(string)`: String that defines what a test is going to do.
2. **`testFunction`** `(function)`: Function where we write our test.
3. **`expectedValue`** `(any)`: Value that is matched with the return value of `testFunction`.

#### Returns

**`null`** : It returns a null object.

#### Example

```
test(
  "Should not be anagram when there is an empty string",
  anagramChecker("lamp", ""),
  false
);
```

#### Output

If your test fails, you will get the description with **red color** and with **the received** and **expected** value. Otherwise you will get the description with **green color**.
